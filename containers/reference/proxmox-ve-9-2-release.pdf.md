PRESS RELEASE
PROXMOX VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT 9.2 WITH
DYNAMIC LOAD BALANCER AVAILABLE

VIENNA, Austria – May 21, 2026 –  Proxmox Server Solutions GmbH today announced the immediate

availability of Proxmox Virtual Environment 9.2, the latest version of its integrated open-source platform for

enterprise virtualization. This major update introduces a dynamic load balancer, expanded software-

defined networking (SDN) capabilities, and granular management of custom CPU models. By improving

resource utilization through dynamic workload balancing and simplifying complex cluster maintenance

workflows, Proxmox VE 9.2 enables organizations to scale their infrastructure with higher efficiency and

significantly reduced operational complexity.

HIGHLIGHTS IN PROXMOX VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT 9.2

DYNAMIC LOAD BALANCER

A highlight of version 9.2 is the introduction of the Dynamic Load Balancer, which utilizes an intelligent

decision-making framework to optimize guest placement for maximum cluster balance and reliability.

Operating in a new dynamic mode, the cluster resource scheduler (CRS) incorporates real-time node and

guest resource utilization into every placement decision. The integrated load balancer can automatically

migrate guests managed by the High Availability (HA) stack to reduce the imbalance across the cluster

nodes while strictly respecting all user-defined HA rules. Administrators maintain granular control through

configurable options that define the behavior and sensitivity of the load balancer through various

parameters, providing organizations with superior oversight of resource utilization in highly available

environments.

EXPANDED SOFTWARE-DEFINED NETWORKING (SDN)

This release significantly improves its SDN stack to support modern network architectures.

• New Fabric Protocols: Native support for WireGuard and BGP has been integrated into the SDN stack.

• BGP/EVPN filtering: Support for route maps and prefix lists allows for fine-grained control over route

redistribution.

Further additions include route redistribution for OSPF fabrics, additional options for configuring EVPN

controllers, and IPv6 underlay support for EVPN.

CUSTOM CPU MODEL MANAGEMENT

To provide greater flexibility for specialized workloads, Proxmox VE 9.2 introduces a dedicated

management interface for custom CPU models. Administrators can now create, edit, and remove custom

CPU profiles directly in the web interface under the “Datacenter” section. This makes it easier to tailor the

virtual CPU features exposed to VMs, ensuring optimal workload performance. Additionally, the integrated

CPU flags selector provides instant visibility into supported flags across all cluster nodes, helping

administrators identify potential cluster-wide compatibility issues during the configuration phase.

CONFIDENT MAINTENANCE WITH HA ARM/DISARM

Addressing common administrative challenges during maintenance windows, Proxmox VE 9.2 introduces

the ability to "disarm" and "arm" the HA Manager cluster-wide. Administrators can temporarily suspend the

HA stack during planned cluster maintenance to prevent unwanted actions, such as fencing nodes. HA

resource states are preserved during these disarm and arm cycles, ensuring HA resources return to their

previous state and node placement automatically once maintenance is completed.

UPDATED TECHNOLOGY STACK

Proxmox Virtual Environment 9.2 is based on Debian 13.5 "Trixie" and features Linux kernel 7.0 as the new

stable default. Along with the latest versions of QEMU 11.0, LXC 7.0, and ZFS 2.4, this release offers a high-

performance open-source architecture for modern infrastructure.

As a complete data center ecosystem engineered for high-density virtualization and disaster recovery,

version 9.2 provides businesses with a seamless management environment for compute, storage, and

backup. This includes updated support for the storage layer, with Ceph Tentacle 20.2.1 now available as a

stable option alongside Ceph Squid 19.2.

AVAILABILITY

Proxmox Virtual Environment 9.2 is open-source software and immediately available for download at the

official website. Users can obtain a complete installation image via ISO download, which contains the full

feature set of the solution and can be installed quickly on bare-metal systems using an intuitive installation

wizard.

Seamless distribution upgrades from older versions of Proxmox Virtual Environment are possible using the

standard APT package management system. Furthermore, it is also possible to install Proxmox Virtual

Environment on top of an existing Debian installation.

For enterprise environments, Proxmox offers comprehensive support plans that provide direct access to

expert support services and stable and secure updates. These support contracts offer a cost-effective way

to secure enterprise-grade stability, with pricing starting at EUR 120 per year and CPU. For more
