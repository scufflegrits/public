PRESS RELEASE
PROXMOX DATACENTER MANAGER 1.1 RELEASED

VIENNA, Austria – May 28, 2026 – Enterprise software developer Proxmox Server Solutions GmbH today

announced the availability of a new point release for Proxmox Datacenter Manager. The centralized

management platform designed to oversee multi-region Proxmox infrastructures introduces new

enhancements including an automated installation workflow, comprehensive subscription handling, unified

Ceph cluster monitoring, and expanded central guest and snapshot management.

HIGHLIGHTS IN PROXMOX DATACENTER MANAGER 1.1

INTEGRATED AUTOMATED INSTALLATION WORKFLOWS

Proxmox Datacenter Manager 1.1 now acts as a central configuration server for provisioning. The

integration of automated installation functionality standardizes the deployment of hosts across distributed

infrastructures. Administrators can centrally manage answer file configurations containing predefined

installation parameters and provide them for unattended installations of new hosts. A new  ‘Automated

Installations’ tab in the ‘Remotes’ section provides access to these workflows, while installation progress can

be tracked directly from within the Proxmox Datacenter Manager web interface. A token-based security

mechanism protects the installation process and helps ensure that prepared configurations are accessed

only by authorized installations.

CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT OF SUBSCRIPTION KEYS

For large-scale deployments, managing subscriptions across multiple sites can be complex. A new

subscription registry in Proxmox Datacenter Manager enables administrators to manage a central pool of

subscription keys, assign them to specific remotes, and remove assignments when no longer needed. A

prepared answer file can also include a specific subscription key, allowing a newly provisioned host to

register its subscription automatically during installation.

UNIFIED CEPH CLUSTER MONITORING

For organizations utilizing hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) powered by Proxmox VE, tracking storage

health across distributed sites is vital. Proxmox Datacenter Manager 1.1 delivers deep, unified visibility

across these distributed storage environments by introducing native monitoring for all connected Ceph

clusters. A single, consolidated panel allows administrators to verify the health, capacity, and real-time

performance of multiple Ceph clusters at a glance. The dashboard provides comprehensive, granular

insight into the status of Object Storage Daemons (OSDs), monitors, managers, Metadata Servers (MDS),

storage pools, CephFS, and specific cluster flags.

ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE VISUALIZATION

New dashboard widgets provide administrators with an overview of their distributed Proxmox

infrastructures:

• Geographic widgets: A new world map widget visualizes the physical locations of connected

remotes. Locations can be defined via the node or datacenter options on Proxmox VE remotes, or

under the configuration settings for Proxmox Backup Server remotes.

•

•

New gauge-based widgets display visual context for CPU, memory, and storage utilization at a

glance.

Local host metrics are now also collected for the Proxmox Datacenter Manager host itself,

visualizing resource consumption through integrated Round-Robin Database (RRD) graphs on the

node status panel.

CENTRAL GUEST AND SNAPSHOT MANAGEMENT

Proxmox Datacenter Manager 1.1 marks the initial milestone toward comprehensive, central guest
management. A new cross-remote view expands guest management by displaying all QEMU virtual

machines and LXC containers across connected remotes. Administrators can display these guests in a

sortable table or in a tree grouped by remote, use text filtering to quickly locate individual guests, and

access frequently used actions from a unified overview.

The same interface now also provides snapshot management for these guest environments. Administrators

can view snapshots in a parent-child tree and create, roll back, delete, or edit snapshot descriptions. In

addition, a new “Resume” action for paused or suspended QEMU virtual machines complements the

existing start, stop, and shutdown operations. As this represents the initial phase of centralized guest

orchestration, users can expect additional day-to-day management tasks to be integrated in upcoming

point releases.

UPDATED TECHNOLOGY STACK

Proxmox Datacenter Manager 1.1 is based on Debian 13.5 “Trixie” and features Linux kernel 7.0 as the new

stable default. Along with ZFS 2.4, this release provides an up-to-date open-source software stack for

modern centralized infrastructure management and day-to-day lifecycle operations.

AVAILABILITY

Proxmox Datacenter Manager 1.1 is open-source software and immediately available for download at the

official website. Users can obtain a complete installation image via ISO download, which contains the full

feature set of the solution and can be installed quickly on bare-metal systems using an intuitive installation

wizard.

Seamless distribution upgrades from older versions of Proxmox Datacenter Manager are possible using the

standard APT package management system. Furthermore, it is also possible to install the platform on top of

an existing Debian installation. As Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS), the entire solution is

published under the GNU AGPLv3.
